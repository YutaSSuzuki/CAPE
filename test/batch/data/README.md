For genome-wide analysis, omics data can be downloaded from several database:  

(1) [PlantDHS](http://plantdhs.org/): DNase-seq data  
(2) [PlantRegMap](http://plantregmap.gao-lab.org/): TF motifs, sequence conservation (CNSs)  
(3) [MBKbase](http://www.mbkbase.org/rice): Genomic variation and phenotypes  

Then, data files are put in the data folder.
